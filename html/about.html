          <p class="p_about">"Poly, The Coral" is a non-profit microsite. This microsite was created to create the awareness of humans through the nature live, which is the coral reefs.
          </p>
          <p class="p_about">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coral reefs are very important to all the living things around the world. Coral reefs protect humans from tidal waves along the coast. It is a home for fish. Even though coral reefs only take up about 1% of the ocean, it plays a huge part in things like making a home for fish and saving coast from tidal waves and flooding. Coral reefs also provide billions dollars and jobs for more than 100 countries around the world.
          </p>
          
          <p class="p_about">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coral reefs can feel the effects of climate change and other detrimental forces at work in the ocean, which humans cannot. The strange changes occurring in the world’s most important reef systems show us that something is terribly wrong.
          </p>
         
          <p class="p_about">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human activities, such as oil exploration, fishing, tourism, and et cetera has caused terrible effects to coral reefs. Coral reefs in Phoenix Island facing problem of endangered in the year of 2002 and dead in the year of 2004. 50% of America’s coral reefs todays are in poor and fair condition. The Great Barrier Reef, the largest reef in the world, which located in Australia, has the risk of dying by 95% in the year of 2050 too.

          <p class="p_about">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dying of coral reefs has become serious compared to the past.

          </p>
        
          <p class="p_about">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our colourful sea is covered with pollution and dust. Our coral reefs are bleached. Climax changed has urged the dying of coral reefs. All of these problems are pushing our planet to the end of balance within living things and the environment.
